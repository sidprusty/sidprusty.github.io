I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. My research focuses on policy design in digital marketing and sustainability. 

In my dissertation paper, I consider monetization of position auctions in retail media (e.g., sponsored listings). Using novel impression-level data obtained from an online retailer, I develop an approach to simultaneously improve retailer profits and advertiser surplus over status quo position auction mechanisms. In another stream of research, I study the market for sustainable products, showing how consumers' heterogeneous preferences for sustainability could produce counter-intuitive insights regarding prices, profits and consumer surplus. In a subsequent paper, I consider regulation of sustainable products.

I employ methods from structural modeling, analytical modeling, machine learning, and operations research, to address problems of interest. My research has been published at *Marketing Science* and the *Proceedings of Machine Learning Research*. I am on the 2025-26 academic job market.
