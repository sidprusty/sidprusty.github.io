I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. I am most interested in research informing policy decisions, both from a firm's and a regulator's perspective. 

In my dissertation paper, I consider monetization of position auctions in retail media, by enhancing the quality score rule used to rank and price these auctions. Using data from an online retailer, I show that proposed quality score enhancements significantly improve retailer profits and advertiser surplus over the status quo. Another stream of research theoretically investigates optimal firm response in the market for sustainable products, finding counter-intuitive insights regarding prices, profits and consumer surplus. A follow-up work considers regulation of sustainable products.

I employ methods from empirical IO, analytical models, machine learning, and operations to address problems of interest. My research has been published at *Marketing Science* and the *Proceedings of Machine Learning Research*.
