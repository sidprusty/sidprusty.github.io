I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. My dissertation paper considers enhancements of position auctions in retail media by improving the quality score algorithm to maximize a retailer's profits from clicks and purchases. Using data from an online retailer, I show that quality score enhancements improve retailer profits and advertisers' revenues. 

Another stream of research theoretically investigates optimal firm response in the market for sustainable products, finding counter-intuitive insights regarding prices, profits and consumer surplus. A follow-up work considers regulation of sustainable products.

I employ methods from empirical IO, analytical models, operations, and statistics to address problems of interest. My research has been published at Marketing Science and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.
